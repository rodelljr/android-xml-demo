From this screen we can see both bars in action, including the content in the middle. All constructed using xml and Fragments. When we go to the second tab we will see a list that consists of an icon image and two text lines inside a CardView. A RecyclerView and Custom Adapter were used to produce the list. Both pages support vertical and horizontal screens. This demo showcases both pages using original xml view techniques.
